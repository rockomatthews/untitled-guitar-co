I used the freely available .svg files from Github (https://github.com/google/material-design-icons) and also added the file name description. 

Unlike other libraries that used raster files, you will be able to change the colors of the icons!!

As someone who has worked with Material Icons for a number of years, I have always been frustrated by their organization (and lack thereof) as well as the redundancy and often poor or seemingly arbitrary descriptions and naming conventions that don’t necessarily match the icon. This often makes them difficult to locate.

So I added some additional descriptions to help with searching for icons as well.

2019.09.21 Update: Removed white fills from backgrounds and updated the framer library.

if you notice errors or think there needs to be changes, updates, etc. Let me know and I’ll try and make changes. You can find me @jimparrillo
